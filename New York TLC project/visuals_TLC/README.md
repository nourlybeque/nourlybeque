#### As a result of the conducted exploratory data analysis, considered trip distance and total amount as key variables to depict a taxi cab ride. The provided scatter plot shows the relationship between the two variables. This scatter plot was created in Tableau to enhance the provided visualization.

#### The Problem: After running initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a sample of the data provided by New York City TLC, it is clear that some of the data will prove an obstacle for accurate ride fare prediction. Namely, trips that have a total cost entered, but a total distance of “0.” At this point, our analysis indicates these to be anomalies or outliers that need to be factored into the algorithm or removed completely.

#### Proposed solution: After analysis, we recommend removing outliers with a total distanced recorded of 0.
