# TikTok Project 

TikTok is the leading destination for short-form mobile video. The platform is built to help imaginations thrive. TikTok's mission is to create a place for inclusive, joyful, and authentic contentâ€“where people can safely discover, create, and connect.
TikTok users have the ability to report videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. This process generates a large number of user reports that are difficult to address quickly. 
TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.

Goal: TikTok seeks a way to use machine learning to extract claims or propositions within TikTok videos and comments and classify each data point as a claim or opinion. 

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Category 1:** 
- **Category 2:**

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here. This section should address the question: "If a stakeholder were to take away 3 main insights from your project, what are the most important things they should know?" You can put yourself in the shoes of a specific stakeholder - for example, a marketing manager or finance director - to think creatively about this section.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
