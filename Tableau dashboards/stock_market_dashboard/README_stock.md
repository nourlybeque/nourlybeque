# Project Background

**Goal:** The Stock Market is available for everyone to invest their money in and in return to have a claim on the percentage of annual revenues of global corporations which is chosen for showing analysis on a complete dashboard.

**Process:** A crucial step of this project is data understanding and accurate calculation of stock price statistics of companies like (Apple, Facebook(Meta), Google, Nvidia, Tesla, and Twitter). First, individual visualizations in worksheets are built, which then are combined into one dashboard.

**Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:**
- Moving average - Open price
- Volume of companies' market share
- A complete table that shows stock prices
- Price percent change in stock of companies

The dataset of the stock market figures of companies like (Apple, Facebook(Meta), Google, Nvidia, Tesla, and Twitter) was downloaded from [Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacksoncrow/stock-market-dataset)
