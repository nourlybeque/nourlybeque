# Project Background

**Goal:** IBM is a multinational technology company in the information technology industry. The goal is to show relevant insights about human resources trends in IBM.

**Process:** A crucial step of this project is data understanding and accurate calculation of video game sales statistics. First, individual visualizations in worksheets are built, which then are combined into one dashboard.

**Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:**
- Gender and job role
- Gender in the company 
- Gender and marital status 
- Number of companies worked for
- Total employees by education field
- Average age by department and job role
- Total employees by department and job role
- Average monthly income by department and job role

The dataset of video game sales was downloaded from [Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)
