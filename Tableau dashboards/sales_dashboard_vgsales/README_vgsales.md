# Project Background

**Goal:** According to global statistics, the video game industry has become a tertiary sector in the entertainment industry. The goal is to show all relevant figures explaining the current trend in video game sales in one dashboard so that every person who has a minimum interest in video games understands it well.

The dataset of video game sales was downloaded from [Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales)

An image for a one-time glance of an interactive Tableau dashboard used to report and explore sales trends can be found [here.](https://github.com/nourlybeque/nourlybeque/blob/31f816e093be1cb353ef8135e1a5fddf3327cc48/Tableau%20dashboards/ibm_hr_dashboard/IBM_Dashboard.png)
