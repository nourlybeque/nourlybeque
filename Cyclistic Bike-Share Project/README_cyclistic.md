#### Clear statement of business task
The business problem is how we can maximize the number of annual memberships of the Cyclistic bike share company as defined by manager, Lily moreno. I was assigned to answer the question that states how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently, by a marketing analytics team. My findings regarding the following question will help to drive the decision making process of the executive team for planning for implementation. 

#### Description of all data sources used
The dataset is located at a publicly available HTML webpage with direct links to download the particular data based on its timeframe. The dataset is organized by time, starting from recent to oldest data available. Each data is given as a .csv format file. The current dataset is recognized as credible (ROCCC: Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current and Cited). Also the privacy, security and accessibility terms are covered by the [license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).  Data integrity will be reached by cleaning data from possible errors at the next stage.

#### Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
First of all, I identified blanks in the dataset by applying filters for all columns. Blanks were identified for columns “start_station_name”, “start_station_id”, “end_station_name” and “end_station_id”. Then I highlighted those blanks and deleted them as entire rows. Secondly, I checked for data integrity by calculating MAX, MIN, Average (mean) and mode of dataset. Finally, I added a column called “ride_length” and determined the figure by subtracting from the column “ended_at” a column “started_at”. The following column shows the duration time of a particular ride. Also, I added a column called “days_of_week”. I determined this column by using the function “WEEKDAY” and criteria for identifying days of week by number starting from 1=Sunday to 7=Saturday.

#### Summary of an analysis
After the data has been organized properly, I calculated maximum and minimum values for the dataset. Also, I determined the mode for the “day_of_week” column in order to identify the most popular weekday in the dataset. Results show that maximum values for ride_length (ride duration) had shown its peak at months May, June, July,  August and September. Moreover, mean (average) values of ride_length showed its highest values at those months mentioned earlier. Here I can say that consumers used bicycles more and had a long ride mostly at the end of spring, during summer season and first month of fall.
In addition, I used the Pivot table (Microsoft Excel) for the dataset. I created informative tables with the help of Pivot. One of those tables highlight the consumer types as an annual member and casual riders. According to the table with an annual timeline, I can say that casual riders had a higher average ride_length (ride duration) than annual members in 2023 for all months. Another informative table shows ride_lengths (ride duration) of casual riders and annual members organized by weekdays. The interesting fact is that casual riders have a fluctuated trend over days of week with higher values of ride_length (ride duration) than annual members. On the other hand, annual members show a stable trend over days of week and lower ride_length (ride duration).

### Top recommendations based on analysis
- Educate casual riders on the perks of memberships as a lack of knowledge can be the reason for the long usage by casual riders
- An ad campaign at the popular start stations for casual riders can increase engagement or interest in memberships
- A campaign to increase the usage by members especially in the less popular months could increase the number of trips. This campaign should provide benefits or rewards for continued usage with a focus on the less popular months.
